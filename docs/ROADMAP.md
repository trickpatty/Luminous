## Roadmap Overview

### Strategic Themes

| Theme | Description | Primary Phases |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Foundation** | Establish architecture, tooling, and core infrastructure | Phase 0 |
| **Visibility** | Make family schedules and tasks visible at a glance | Phase 1-2 |
| **Mobility** | Enable management and notifications on the go | Phase 3 |
| **Coordination** | Expand to meal planning, lists, and caregiver sharing | Phase 4 |
| **Intelligence** | Add AI-powered features (Magic Import, suggestions) | Phase 5 |
| **Ecosystem** | Platform extensions, integrations, community | Phase 6+ |

### Release Philosophy

Following TOGAF's principle of iterative architecture development:

2. **Minimum Lovable Product (MLP)**: Phase 2 adds task management and rewards
3. **Full Product**: Phases 3-4 complete the companion apps and household features
4. **Platform**: Phases 5-6 enable extensibility and community contributions

## Future Vision

### Beyond Phase 6

These features are under consideration for future development:

| Feature | Description | Considerations |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Multiple Displays** | Sync across multiple displays in home | Technical complexity, use case validation |
| **AR/VR Integration** | View schedule in AR glasses | Hardware dependency, limited audience |
| **Wearable Support** | Apple Watch / Wear OS companion | Reduced scope, notification focus |
| **Smart Home Routines** | Trigger home automation from routines | Integration complexity |
| **Family Games** | Educational games as rewards | Conflicts with zero-distraction |
| **Photo Frame Mode** | Display family photos when idle | Scope creep risk |
| **Video Messages** | Short video notes for family | Conflicts with zero-distraction |

### Technology Evolution

| Current | Future Consideration | Rationale |
|---------|---------------------|-----------|
| Electron | Tauri | Smaller bundle, better performance |
| Angular | Angular with Signals | Reactive improvements |
| Cosmos DB | Azure Cosmos DB Serverless | Cost optimization for smaller deployments |
| In-house Auth | External IdP | Consider delegating if maintenance burden increases |
| Azure Functions | Azure Container Apps | More flexibility for long-running jobs |

### Critical Path

The critical path for MVP delivery:

```
0.1 Dev Environment → 0.3 Core Structure → 0.5 Domain Models →
1.1 Display Shell → 1.2 Calendar Integration → 1.3 Calendar Views →
1.7 Offline → MVP Release
```

### Optional Parallel Tracks

These can be developed in parallel after Phase 0:

- **Web App MVP**: Basic web access (Phase 1 parallel)
- **Additional Calendar Providers**: Outlook, iCloud (Phase 1+)
- **Sync Server**: Multi-device sync (Phase 3 parallel)
