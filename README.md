# Luminous
A digital family command center that makes time, responsibilities, and plans visible to everyone

This project provides a **single, shared view of daily life** — schedules, tasks, reminders, and household context — optimized for **clarity, glanceability, and reliability** for people of all ages (from young children to older adults).

## What This Is

This software turns a large, portrait‑mounted touchscreen into a **digital household command center**:

* A shared calendar that makes time easy to understand at a glance
* Clear visibility into what’s happening now, next, and later
* Household tasks and responsibilities without friction
* Simple notes and reminders that fade when no longer relevant
* An interface that works even if you never touch it

It is designed to behave like an **appliance**, not a computer.

---

## What This Is Not

This project is intentionally **not**:

* A tablet launcher
* A smart‑home control dashboard
* A phone app scaled up to a big screen
* A notification feed or productivity tool for power users

The goal is calm, shared understanding — not feature density.

## Design Principles

These principles guide all development decisions:

1. **Glanceable First**
   You should understand what matters from across the room.

2. **Shared by Default**
   The display represents the household, not an individual user.

3. **All Ages, No Training**
   If you can tap a microwave, you can use this.

4. **Touch Is Optional**
   The system must be useful even without interaction.

5. **Always On, Always Recoverable**
   Power loss, reboots, or updates should never require human intervention.

6. **Calm by Design**
   No ads, no clutter, no attention‑grabbing behavior.

## Core Capabilities

* **Calendar aggregation** (family, personal, school, work)
* **Human‑readable time views** (now / next / today / tomorrow)
* **Household tasks and chores** with clear ownership
* **Notes and short messages** for shared context
* **Always‑on display mode** for large portrait screens
* **Touch interaction** that is forgiving and reversible

---

## Hardware Assumptions

The software is designed for:

* Large portrait displays (≈ 23"–32")
* Capacitive touch (PCAP) preferred
* Wall‑mounted in shared spaces
* Wired or Wi‑Fi networking
* Automatic boot‑to‑UI on power restore

The project is hardware‑agnostic and can run on Linux‑based systems, mini PCs, or other kiosk‑style environments.

## Philosophy

Homes already have enough screens demanding attention.

This project exists to create **one calm, shared surface** that helps a household stay aligned — without noise, ads, or subscriptions.

If it quietly does its job and fades into the background of daily life, it’s working.
